# PyBer_Analysis
BootCamp Week 5
Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
# Overview
PyBer is a transportation by Aplication Company. We must create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and we will present this in a  multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We will deliver a  written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results

From the data of  the citi_data.csv & the ride_data.csv we created a new Data Frame with the information we need for the purpose of this proyect, by using the *groupby dataframe function* to get the total number of trips made, the total number of drivers and the rates per driver and per trip, this  for each type of trips the company makes: Urban, Suburban and Rural.
